I still can't believe our first win as .;,;. was on corCTF of all CTFs! That's actually insane.

Really really happy with how we did, and I can't believe this is how we qualify for DiceCTF finals :joy:. Anyway, here are writeups for the challenges I did. Even though one of them is forensics actually they were all reverse engineering.

We get an ELF file, a short C File, and finally some terminal output.

```c
#include <stdio.h>     // printf
#include <stdlib.h>    // malloc and free
#include <string.h>    // memcpy
#include <sys/stat.h>  //statf

int file_info(char \* file)
{
struct stat statf[1];
struct stat control[1];

        if (stat(file, statf) < 0)
                return -1;

        /* Turn on stable fields */
        memset(control, 0, sizeof(control));
        control->st_ino = statf->st_ino;
        control->st_dev = statf->st_dev;
        control->st_rdev = statf->st_rdev;
        control->st_uid = statf->st_uid;
        control->st_gid = statf->st_gid;
        control->st_size = statf->st_size;
        control->st_mtime = statf->st_mtime;
        control->st_ctime = statf->st_ctime;

    // Print readable file information
    printf("\nInode Number: %lu\n", control->st_ino);
        printf("Device Number: %lu\n", control->st_dev);
        printf("Device ID: %lu\n", control->st_rdev);
        printf("User ID: %u\n", control->st_uid);
        printf("Group ID: %u\n", control->st_gid);
        printf("File Size: %ld\n", control->st_size);
        printf("Last Modification Time: %ld\n", control->st_mtime);
        printf("Last Status Change Time: %ld\n\n", control->st_ctime);

        return 0;

}

int main(int argc, char \*\* argv)
{
file_info(argv[1]);
return 1;
}

```

The C file isn't really useful. It's mostly just there to show that the `./file_information` command run in the terminal output prints the results of the `stat` function on the original `/bin/sh`.

On the other hand, the terminal output tells us a lot. First, it tells us that the flag binary was generated from running `shc` on a shell script called `flag.sh`. The goal of the challenge is probably to recover this shell script to get the flag.

`shc` is a [shell script compiler](https://github.com/neurobin/shc). It takes a shell script, and "compiles" it into a binary. However, by "compile", it actually means encrypting the original script and embedding it into the binary.

In this case, we have a few flags that change the behavior of `shc`:

-   `-U` tells `shc` to create an untraceable (no strace/ptrace) binary
-   `-H` tells `shc` to create a "hardened" binary, which only works for the default shell and supposedly makes it harder to reverse engineer.
-   `-v` is for verbose, and `-o` and `-f` are for output and input files respectively.

### rev in disguise

If we toss the binary into a decompiler, we see a fairly interesting main function:

```c
int32_t main(int32_t argc, char** argv, char** envp)
    sub_32eb()
    sub_366b(*argv)
    argv[1] = sub_37b8(argc, argv)
    char const* const r12

    if (argv[1] == 0)
        r12 = "<null>"
    else
        r12 = argv[1]

    char* rbx_1

    if (*__errno_location() == 0)
        rbx_1 = &data_4102
    else
        rbx_1 = strerror(errnum: *__errno_location())

    void* const rax_17

    if (*__errno_location() == 0)
        rax_17 = &data_4102
    else
        rax_17 = &data_49d8

    fprintf(stream: stderr, format: "%s%s%s: %s\n", *argv, rax_17, rbx_1, r12, argv)
    return 1
```

If we try running it, we fail a check in `sub_32eb`, the first function:

```
$ ./flag
Operation not permitted
Killed
```

```c
int64_t sub_32eb()
    void* fsbase
    int64_t rax = *(fsbase + 0x28)
    prctl(option: 4, 0)
    prctl(option: 0x59616d61, 0xffffffff)
    int32_t rax_3 = getppid()
    int64_t s
    __builtin_memset(&s, c: 0, n: 0x100)
    sub_31cf(rax_3, &s)

    if (strcmp(&s, "bash") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/bin/bash") != 0 && strcmp(&s, &data_4918) != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/bin/sh") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "sudo") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/bin/sudo") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/usr/bin/sudo") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "gksudo") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/bin/gksudo") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/usr/bin/gksudo") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "kdesu") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/bin/kdesu") != 0 && strcmp(&s, "/usr/bin/kdesu") != 0)
        puts(str: "Operation not permitted")
        kill(zx.q(getpid()), 9)
        exit(status: 1)
        noreturn

    if (rax == *(fsbase + 0x28))
        return rax - *(fsbase + 0x28)

    __stack_chk_fail()
    noreturn
```

All we need to do is patch out the call to this function and the binary will continue.

Here's what it does after ignoring the first function:

```
$ ./flag_patched
sh: 1: .����ޙC��Wjm�b˪�#��s��E۶$�Бt�: not found
sh: 2: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")
```

Clearly something is going wrong in the decryption here. Thankfully, we have a cool trick up our sleeve that means we don't need to reverse anything else!

### who actually wants to rev though

Yep! We can use our good ol' friend `LD_PRELOAD` to intercept the library calls used by the binary. I won't go over the technique since there's lots of better tools to learn it elsewhere, but essentially it let's use provide our own definition for functions like `execve` and `stat` that the binary uses.

Additionally I'll skip over the process of enumerating each and every function since only a few are useful. Here's the final code I ended up using:

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>     // printf
#include <sys/stat.h>  // statf
#include <dlfcn.h>

int stat(const char _**restrict** \_\_file, struct stat _**restrict** **buf) {
    int (_real_stat)(const char _**restrict\_\_ **file, struct stat \***restrict\_\_ **buf) = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "stat");
    if (strcmp(**file, "/bin/sh") == 0) {
        **buf->st_ino = 42467530;
        **buf->st_dev = 2050;
        **buf->st_rdev = 0;
        **buf->st_uid = 0;
        **buf->st_gid = 0;
        **buf->st_size = 125688;
        **buf->st_mtime = 1648043363;
        **buf->st_ctime = 1686442713;
        printf("stat: %s\n", **file);
        return 0;
    }
    return real_stat(**file, \_\_buf);
}

int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]) {
    int (*real_execvp)(const char *file, char \*const argv[]) = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "execvp");
    printf("execvp: %s\n", file);
    for (int i = 0; argv[i] != NULL; i++) {
        printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    return real_execvp(file, argv);
}

int system(const char *command) {
    int (*real_system)(const char \*command) = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "system");
    printf("system: %s\n", command);
    return real_system(command);
}

FILE* fopen(const char *filename, const char _mode) {
    FILE_ (*real_fopen)(const char *filename, const char \*mode) = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "fopen");
    printf("fopen: %s %s\n", filename, mode);
    return real_fopen(filename, mode);
}

// gcc -shared -fPIC -o ld_preload.so ld_preload.c
```


At some point in the binary, it uses the results of the `stat` function on `/bin/sh` to help decrypt the shell script. However, since we know the outputs of this function from the terminal output, we can override this specific call to return the proper inputs to successfully decrypt the shell script.

Putting it all together, we can compile the above code to a shared object, and run the patched flag binary with `LD_PRELOAD` properly set, and we get the flag!
```bash
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o ld_preload.so ld_preload.c
$ LD_PRELOAD=./ld_preload.so ./flag_patched
stat: /bin/sh
fopen: /tmp/shc_x.c w
fopen: /tmp/shc_x.c w
system: cc -Wall -fpic -shared -o /tmp/shc_x.so /tmp/shc_x.c -ldl
system: cc -Wall -fpic -shared -o /tmp/shc_x.so /tmp/shc_x.c -ldl
fopen: /tmp/cc76RMn7.s w
fopen: /tmp/ccN7B49z.s w
fopen: /tmp/shc_x.c r
fopen: /tmp/shc_x.c r
... [truncated]
system: #!/bin/sh

# corctf{shell_script_compilers_are_not_safe_rc4_is_dumb_this_challenge_sucks}
echo "corctf{not_the_flag}"

corctf{not_the_flag}
```

The final shell script has the flag as a comment, meaning we had to actually retrieve the whole script, but the `system` call sees it all anyway, so we're good to go!

## rev/cormine

**Note: This is a 2-part challenge, but my solution solves both parts so I'll just be writing as one challenge. Both challenges use the same binary.**

As a warning, this challenge is a Rust Bevy binary, meaning it is HUGE. I won't pasting whole decompilations, so it might be a bit hard to find exactly where I'm talking about (I'll give addresses though). ~~also binja op~~

### Saving the level
First things first, obviously the flag is somehow stored inside our given `.cms` files. We don't want to look for this logic just yet, since the binary is really big, but there is a trick we can use.

Since we know `F9` saves the level to `game.cms`, it must run the same logic as loading a save, just in reverse. 

Good thing for us, searching for the string `game.cms` gives us pretty close to our target location.
```c
0x1db8140 int64_t <bevy_ecs::system::function_system::FunctionSystem<Marker,F> as bevy_ecs::system::system::System>::run_unsafe::hf653820ccd9abe7c(void* arg1, void* arg2) {
    ...
    __builtin_strncpy(dest: &str, src: "game.cms", n: 9)
    uint32_t (* buf_1)[0x40] = &str
    core::ffi::c_str::CStr::from_bytes_with_nul::h4e10a7c7207d9b50()
    void*** rbx_6
    
    if (buf != 0)
        rbx_6 = anyhow::error::<impl cor...yhow::Error>::from::he4dc447bd7a8c078(&str_"file name contained an unexpected NUL byte")
    else
        std::sys::pal::unix::fs::File::open_c::h1e3e50edcc9152f4()
        struct RustStringSlice* var_2a0
        
        if (var_2a8.d != 0)
            rbx_6 = anyhow::error::<impl cor...yhow::Error>::from::he4dc447bd7a8c078(var_2a0)
        else
            int32_t fd = var_2a8:4.d
            str[0] = rsi_2.d
            uint64_t nbytes_4 = 4
            
            while (true)
                uint64_t nbytes = 0x7fffffffffffffff
                
                if (nbytes_4 u< 0x7fffffffffffffff)
                    nbytes = nbytes_4
                
                ssize_t rax_42 = write(fd, buf: buf_1, nbytes)
                ...
```
We can see that a file is being opened, presumably `game.cms`, and then later written to. 

Scrolling a bit further down, we see something very intimdating:
![Lots of multiplication and addition by 2 constants](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine_constants.png)

At first glance, this is definitely some inlined operation. Thankfully, if we extract the two constants `0x5851f42d4c957f2d` and `-0x5e89ab1b9041e80d`, we can google their numerical values `6364136223846793005` and `11634580027462260723`, and we find [this result](https://github.com/rust-random/rand/blob/master/rand_core/src/lib.rs#L359):

![rust random seed_from_u64 source](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine_seed_from_u64.png)

That means this function must be creating some PRNG with a seed. Problem is, what's the PRNG or the seed? 

### Slide to the left...
Scrolling down just a tiny bit more, we see two function calls:
![rand_chacha::guts::init_chacha](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine_chacha_init.png)
![rand_chacha::guts::refill_wide_6](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine_refill_wide_6.png)

We can probably guess that the we have some ChaCha based PRNG, and by doing a quick search for the `rand_chacha` crate and with the information of the second function call having an argument of 6, we can assume that we are seeding a [ChaCha12Rng](https://docs.rs/rand_chacha/latest/rand_chacha/struct.ChaCha12Rng.html). If you're aware of how the SALSA/ChaCha family of PRNGs work, this makes sense since the argument being 6 is the number of odd/even rounds, which means 12 rounds total, so `ChaCha12Rng`.

### ...and slide to the right
Now, we could keep going and see how the PRNG is used to help save the file, but remember, our goal is to *load* the file, not save it. So, let's look at other places these functions are called.

As you can see from the amazingly labeled diagram, there's just one other place where the function is called 4 times, and that's where the save is being loaded.
![cormine_save_and_load](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine_save_and_load.png)

Going to the `load` calls, we can scroll up to see where it opens and first reads from the file. This function is really long and complex, so here's a basically condensed version of the important bit:
```c
0x1d98f60 int64_t <bevy_ecs::system::function_system::FunctionSystem<Marker,F> as bevy_ecs::system::system::System>::run_unsafe::h06b810d262677ad4(void* arg1, void* arg2) {
    uint32_t tmp_buf[0x40]
    ...
    uint64_t nbytes = 4
    uint32_t (* buf_1)[0x40] = &tmp_buf

    ssize_t rax_11 = read(fd /* our save file */, buf: buf_1, nbytes) 
    ...
    uint64_t seed = zx.q(tmp_buf[0])
    // This `seed` value eventually becomes the first value in the `seed_from_u64` inline function
}
```

This means the first 4 bytes of the file are actually our seed for the ChaCha PRNG! Right after this section it reads in 2 bytes. I assume this is for the size of the world, but it's not super important and I didn't look into it.

Next, scrolling past the inline `seed_from_u64` and `init_chacha`, we get to this section (again, this is heavily condensed):
```c
uint128_t rdx = cormine_shared::save::Serializer<Cursor>::read_leb128_signed::he32d2bd5e2a4a56b(fd);
int32_t X = rdx.d ^ chacha_buf[chacha_i];
chacha_i += 1;

rdx = cormine_shared::save::Serializer<Cursor>::read_leb128_signed::he32d2bd5e2a4a56b(fd);
int32_t Y = rdx.d ^ chacha_buf[chacha_i];
chacha_i += 1;

rdx = cormine_shared::save::Serializer<Cursor>::read_leb128_signed::he32d2bd5e2a4a56b(fd);
int32_t Z = rdx.d ^ chacha_buf[chacha_i];
chacha_i += 1;

char type;
read(fd, &type, 1);

type ^= chacha_buf[chacha_i].b;

struct Block block = {X, Y, Z, type}; // Obviously it doesn't look like this in the decomp but you get the idea that it gets packed into a struct
``` 

It reads in 3 values, XORs them with the PRNG output to get the position of the block, then XORs just a single byte with the PRNG output to get the type of the block.

As for how it reads in the values, here's what the decomp of the function looks like:

```c
uint64_t cormine_shared::save::Serializer<Cursor>::read_leb128_signed::he32d2bd5e2a4a56b(int32_t fd) {
    int32_t rcx = 0
    int64_t rdx = 0
    while (true)
        char var_41 = 0
        uint64_t nbytes_2 = 1
        char* buf = &var_41
        
        while (true)
            uint64_t nbytes = 0x7fffffffffffffff
            
            if (nbytes_2 u< 0x7fffffffffffffff)
                nbytes = nbytes_2
            
            ssize_t rax_4 = read(fd, buf, nbytes)
            struct RustStringSlice* const r12_2
            
            if (rax_4 == -1)
                int64_t r12_1 = sx.q(*__errno_location())
                
                if (r12_1 != 4)
                    r12_2 = r12_1 << 0x20 | 2
                else if (nbytes_2 == 0)
                    label_1dce768:
                    uint64_t rdi_1 = zx.q(var_41)
                    
                    if (rcx != 0x3f || rdi_1 == 0 || rdi_1.d == 0x7f)
                        uint64_t result = zx.q(rdi_1.d & 0x7f) << rcx.b
                        rdx |= result
                        rcx += 7
                        
                        if (rdi_1.b s>= 0)
                            return result
                        
                        break
                    
                    if (rdi_1.b s< 0)
                        nbytes_2 = 1
                        char* buf_1 = &var_41
                        r12_2 = &str_"failed to fill whole buffer"

Here's my reimplementation in Rust, do note that since each XOR is done with one uint32, we can return a u64 and just cast it to a u32 when needed.
```rust
fn read_serialized<R: Read>(reader: &mut R) -> u64 {
    let mut buf = [0; 1];
    let mut result = 0;
    let mut shift = 0;
    let mask = 0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff;
    loop {
        reader.read_exact(&mut buf).unwrap();
        let byte = buf[0];
        result = result | ((byte & 0x7f) as u64) << shift;
        shift += 7;
        if byte & 0x80 == 0 {
            if byte & 0x40 != 0 {
                result |= (mask << shift) & mask;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    result
}
```

### Putting it all together
Now all we have to do is basically reimplement the reader and just dump the map to a file. Here's my final parser, ~~yes i know i suck at rust ok i just wanted to solve the challenge~~:


```rust
use byteorder::ReadBytesExt;
use byteorder::LittleEndian;
use rand_chacha::rand_core::RngCore;
use rand_chacha::rand_core::SeedableRng;
use rand_chacha::ChaCha12Rng;
use std::env;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::io::Read;

fn read_serialized<R: Read>(reader: &mut R) -> u64 {
    let mut buf = [0; 1];
    let mut result = 0;
    let mut shift = 0;
    let mask = 0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff;
    loop {
        reader.read_exact(&mut buf).unwrap();
        let byte = buf[0];
        result = result | ((byte & 0x7f) as u64) << shift;
        shift += 7;
        if byte & 0x80 == 0 {
            if byte & 0x40 != 0 {
                result |= (mask << shift) & mask;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    result
}

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    if args.len() != 2 {
        eprintln!("Usage: {} <file>", args[0]);
        std::process::exit(1);
    }

    let file = std::fs::File::open(&args[1]).unwrap();
    let mut rdr = BufReader::new(file);

    let seed = rdr.read_u32::<LittleEndian>().unwrap() as u64;
    rdr.read_u16::<LittleEndian>().unwrap(); // Not sure what this is used for


    let mut rng = ChaCha12Rng::seed_from_u64(seed);
    let mut tmp = [0u8; 1];

    let mut decrypt = |dat: u64| -> u32 {
        let prng_out = rng.next_u32();
        (dat as u32) ^ prng_out
    };

    loop {
        let x = decrypt(read_serialized(&mut rdr));
        let y = decrypt(read_serialized(&mut rdr));
        let z = decrypt(read_serialized(&mut rdr));
        rdr.read_exact(&mut tmp).unwrap();
        let typ = decrypt(tmp[0] as u64) as u8;

        println!("{}, {}, {}, {}", x as i32, y as i32, z as i32, typ as i32);

        if rdr.read_exact(&mut tmp).is_err() {
            break;
        }
        rdr.seek_relative(-1).unwrap();
    }
}
```



Running this on the `cormine1.cms` file, we get the following output [(download)](/files/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine1.txt):
```text
1, 95, 16, 0
2, 95, 16, 0
3, 95, 16, 0
4, 95, 16, 0
0, 94, 16, 0
0, 93, 16, 0
0, 92, 16, 0
1, 91, 16, 0
2, 91, 16, 0
3, 91, 16, 0
4, 91, 16, 0
7, 95, 16, 0
8, 95, 16, 0
9, 95, 16, 0
6, 94, 16, 0
...
```

Now, remember this isn't the flag, its just the blocks we have. All we need to do to get the flag is to just visualize the block id 0s, and we get the flag!
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = open('dump.txt').readlines()
data = [eval(x.strip()) for x in data]

data = [(x, y, z, id) for (x, y, z, id) in data if id == 0]

x = [d[0] / 2 for d in data]
y = [d[1] for d in data]

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.scatter(x, y, s=10)
plt.ylim(50, 150)
plt.savefig('cormine1_flag.png')
```
![cormine1 flag](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine1_flag.png)

And our flag is `corctf{w4llh4cks}`.

For the second part, we can repeat the exact same thing, getting this output [(download)](/files/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine2.txt):
```text
1, 95, 16, 3
1, 95, 16, 255
2, 95, 16, 3
2, 95, 16, 255
3, 95, 16, 3
3, 95, 16, 255
4, 95, 16, 3
4, 95, 16, 255
0, 94, 16, 3
0, 94, 16, 255
0, 93, 16, 3
0, 93, 16, 255
...
```

As you can see, the old blocks are being overwritten with an invalid block id. All we have to do is just ignore these and only plot the id 3, and we get the flag!
```diff
- data = [(x, y, z, id) for (x, y, z, id) in data if id == 0]
+ data = [(x, y, z, id) for (x, y, z, id) in data if id == 3]
```

![cormine2 flag](/img/writeups/2024/corCTF-24/cormine2_flag.png)

And our flag is `corctf{0v3rwrit3}`.
