# And here's to many more!
Wow... 

Happy (1-week late) new years everyone! I can't believe it's already 2024.

I've been pretty busy with irl stuff and enjoying vacation so the befunge post will still take a little longer xd.

In the meanwhile, I hope everyone is enjoying the port to Astro for the time being. I ended up choosing Astro over eleventy for a variety of reasons and also just on a whim, but it does come will some cool perks like not needing anymore javascript at all (which is pretty cool imo).

Even for LaTeX! :sunglasses:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Anyway, for this year I'll definitely be putting up some more posts, including a few more writeups. 
Currently, besides the Befunge post, I'm also working on a writeup for the 2023 NSA Codebreaker Challenge, which was a lot of fun. 

That's all for now, see you next time!
